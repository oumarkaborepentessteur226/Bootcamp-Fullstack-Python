    <p  style=" color: white; text-shadow: 0 0 10px black;  margin-left: 100px;">"Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as the Asgardians, 
        a group of humanoid <br> beings from the pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal.
        Thor is the son of Odin<br>, the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known as 
        Vikings and became part of<br> Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted Uru hammer Mjolnir,
        which helps him to channel <br>his godly energies, he became the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. 
        When his irresponsible and <br>impetuous behavior became too much, Odin sent him to Midgard
        (more commonly known as Earth)<br> as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,
        stripped of his memory. After<br> learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly powers.
        Thor went on to become a champion <br>for Midgard as well as one of the founding members of the Avengers, 
        "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".</p>
